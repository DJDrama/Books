[Testing flow]
	(Transformation functions)
		- "take"
			-> easiest way to test an infinite flow is by limiting the number of its elements using "take".

	(Testing infinite flows)
		- testing classes that use StateFlow or SharedFlow is a bit more complictaed.

			1) they need a scope
				-> if we define our test using runTest, this scope should be backgroundScope, not this, so our test does not await this scope's completion.

			2) These flows are infinite
				-> they don't complete unless their scope is cancelled.

	(Determining how many connections were opened)

	(Testing view models)
		- using SharedFlow as a source and emitting elements in the test.
