Item 59: Consider using mutable collections

	- adding elements to mutable collections is generally faster, but immutable collections give us more control over how they are changed.

	- in the local scope we generally do not need this control, so mutable collections should be preferred. (Especially in util functions, where elements insertion might happen many times)

	* map {} uses mutable collection inside the implementation!
