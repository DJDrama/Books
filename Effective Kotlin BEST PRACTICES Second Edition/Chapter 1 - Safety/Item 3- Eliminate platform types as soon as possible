Item 3: Eliminate platform types as soon as possible
	- @Nullable -> String?
	- @NotNull -> String

	- what if type is not annotated with either of above annotations?
		-> we should treat it as "nullable" (everything is nullalbe in Java)


	- "platform type"
		-> a type that comes from another language and has unknown nullability.

		-> since they are dangerous, we should eliminiate as soon as possible and not let them propagate.

		* it's good to specify types using annotations that specify nullability for exposed Java constructors, methods and fields.
