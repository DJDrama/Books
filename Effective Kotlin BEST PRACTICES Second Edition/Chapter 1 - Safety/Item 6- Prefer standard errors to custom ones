Item 6: Prefer standard errors to custom ones
	
	- you should use exceptions from the standard library instead of defining your own.

	(Common Exceptions)
		- IllegalArgumentException
			-> indicates that an argument passed to a method is invalid.
			-> typically use "require", "requireNotNull"

		
		- IllegalStateException
			-> state is invalid.
				ex) when a variable is not initialized yet
			-> typically use "check", "checkNotNull"

		- UnsupportedOperationException
			-> declared method is not supported by the object.
			-> typically throw using "TODO" function from Kotlin stdlib.

		- IndexOutOfBoundsException

		- ConcurrentModificationException

		- NoSuchElementException
			-> element does not exist.
				ex) Iterable, and the client asks for "next" when there are no more elements.
