Item 46: Avoid member extensions

	* do not define extensions as members just to restrict visibility!
		-> member extension functions do not restrict visibility.

	- you should restrict an extension's visibility by using a visibility modifier, not by making it a member.

	<Why to avoid extension functions>
		1. Reference is not supported
		2. Implicit access to both receivers might be confusing

	<Avoid, not prohibit>
