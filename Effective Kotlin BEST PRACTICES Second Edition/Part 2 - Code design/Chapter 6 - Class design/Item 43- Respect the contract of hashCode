Item 43: Respect the contract of hashCode
	- hashCode function is used in a popular data structure called a "hash table"

	<Hash Table>
		- assign a number to each element.(hash function)
		(hash function)
			1. is Fast
			2. returns different values for unequal elements

	<The problem with mutability>
		- we should not use mutable elements for sets or as keys for maps

	<The contract of hashCode>
		1. hashCode should be consistent.
		2. hashCode always needs to be consistent with equals, and equal elements must have the same hash code.

	<Implementing hashCode>
		- typical way
			-> every time we add the enext one we multiply the result by the number 31.

			(We can use Kotin/JVM's Objects.hash(...) function)
