Item 31: Respect abstraction contracts

	* When you break the contract, it is your problem when the implementation changes and your code stops working.

	<Contracts are inherited>
		- repsect the expectations on the functions you override.
			ex) class should have both "hashcode" and "equals" when need to implement one of them.
