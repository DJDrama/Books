Item 35: Consider using dependency injection

	* In Kotlin, the most popular way to do depdency injection is to use "constructor-based dependency injection".

	* IOC(Inversion of Control)
		- Instead of creating instances of the classes your class needs to compose, you specify the types of these dependencies in the constructor of your class.
			-> instead of creating its dependencies on its own, a class receives them from the outside.

	(Advantages)
		- Makes dependencies explicit.
			-> when you look at the constructor of a class, you know what dependencies it has.

		- Makes testing easier.
			-> you can easily mock dependencies and test your class in isolation

		- Makes your code more reusable
			-> if you define your dependency with an interface, you can reuse your class in different contexts by providing different implementations of dependencies.
