Item 35: Consider using dependency injection

	* In Kotlin, the most popular way to do depdency injection is to use "constructor-based dependency injection".
	
	* IOC(Inversion of Control)
		- Instead of creating instances of the classes your class needs to compose, you specify the types of these dependencies in the constructor of your class.
			-> instead of creating its dependencies on its own, a class receives them from the outside.
