Item 14: Consider referencing receivers explicitly

	<Many receivers>
		- use explicit receivers like "this.name" instead of "name"


	* Do not change a scope's receiver just because you can.
		-> might be confusing to have too many receivers that all give us methods we can use.
			(An explicit argument or reference is generally better)
