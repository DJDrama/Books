Item 13: Consider making types explicit

	* Type should be specified if it is not clear
		ex)
			===============================================================
			val data = getSomeData() // Unclear

			val data: UserData = getSomeData() // Clear (Explicit type)
			===============================================================

	- we specify explicit types to improve not only readability but also safety.

	* Type might be important information for both a developer and the compiler.
	* Whenever it is, do not hesitate to specify it. It costs little and can help a lot.

		-> Important for readability.



	<Explicit API mode for library authors>
		- Kotlin forces us to specify types and visibility modifiers for all declarations that are part of our public API
