Item 9: Write unit tests

	- With unit tests, we typically check

		1) Common use cases (the happy path)
		2) Common error cases or potential problems
		3) Edge cases and illegal arguments

	(Advatages)
		- reliable
		- not afraid to refactor it
			-> if not tested, developers are scared of touching legacy code
		- much faster to check if something works correctly using unit tests rather than checking it manually.

	(Disadvantages)
		- It takes time (HOWEVER! good unit tests probably save time as we spend less time debugging and looking for bugs later.)
		- Everyone needs to learn how to properly unit test their code.
