Item 4: Minimize the scope of variables

	* When we tighten a variable's scope, it is easier to keep our programs simple to track and manage.

	* It is easier to track how mutable properties change when they can only be modified in a small scope.

	* variables with a wide scope might be overused by another developer.

	* whether a variable is read-only or read-write, we always prefer it to be initialized when it is defined.


	<Capturing>
		- we should be aware of problems with unintentional capturing.
			-> to prevent them, we should avoid mutability and prefer a narrower scope for variables.
