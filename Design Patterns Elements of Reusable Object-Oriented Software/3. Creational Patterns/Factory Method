Factory Method
	(Intent)
		Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
		Lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

	(Also Known As)
		Virtual Constructor

	(Applicability)
		Use it when
			1. a class can't participate the class of objects it must create.
			2. a class wants its subclasses to specify the objects it creates.
			3. classes delegate responsibility to one of several helper subclasses, and you want to localize the knowledge of which helper subclass is the delegate.

	(Consequences)
		- eliminates the need to bind application-specific classes into your code.

		- (potential disadvantage)
			-> clients might have to subclass the Creator class just to create a particular ConcreteProduct object.

		1. Provides hooks for subclasses.
			-> creating objects inside a class with a factory method is always more flexible than creating an object directly.

		2. Connects parallel class hierarchies.
