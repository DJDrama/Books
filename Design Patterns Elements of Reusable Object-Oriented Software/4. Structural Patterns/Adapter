[Adapter]
	(Intent)
		- Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect.
		- Lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

	(Also Known As)
		- Wrapper

	(Applicability)
		Use when
			1. you want to use an existing class, and its interface does not match the one you need.

			2. you want to create a reusable class that cooperates with unrelated or unforeseen classes, that is, classes that don't necessarily have compatible interfaces.

			3. (object adapter only) you need to use several exsiting subclasses, but it's impractical to adapt their interface by subclassing every one. An object adapter can adapt the interface of its parent class.
