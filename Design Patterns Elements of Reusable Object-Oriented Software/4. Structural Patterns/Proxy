[Proxy]

	(Intent)
		- provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to iot.

	(AKA)
		- Surrogate

	(Applicability)
		1. A remote proxy provides a local presentative of an object in a different address space

		2. A virtual proxy creates expensive objects on demand

		3. A protection proxy controls access to the original object

		4. A smart reference is a replacement for a bare pointer that performs additional actions when an object is accessed.

	(Consequences)
		1. remote proxy can hide the fact that an object resides in a different address space.

		2. virtual proxy can perform optimizations such as creating an object on demand

		3. protection proxies and smart references allow additional housekeeping tasks when an object is accessed.
