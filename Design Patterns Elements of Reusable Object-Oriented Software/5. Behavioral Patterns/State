State

	(Intent)
		- Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
		- The object will appear to change its class.

	(AKA)
		- Objects for States

	(Applicability)
		Use it when
			1. An object's behavior depends on its state, and it must change its behavior at run-time depending on that state.

			2. Operations have large, multipart conditional statements that depend on the object's state.

	(Consequences)
		1. It localizes state-specific behavior and partitions behavior for different states.

		2. It makes state transitions explicit.

		3. State objects can be shared.

	(Related Patterns)
		- Flyweight explains when and how State objects can be shared.

		- State objects are often Singletons.
