Interpreter
	
	(Intent)
		- given a language, define a representation for its grammar along with an interpreter that uses the representation to interpret sentences in the language.

	(Motivation)
		- describes how to define a grammar for simple languages, represent senteces in the language, and interpret these sentences.

		- uses a class to represent each grammar rule.

	(Applicability)
		- pattern works best when

			1. the grammar is simple

			2. efficiency is not a critical concern.

	(Consequences)
		1. easy to change and extend the grammar.
			-> can use inheritance to change or extend the grammar.
		
		2. implementing the grammar is easy

		3. complex grammars are hard to maintain.

		4. adding new ways to interpret expressions.
