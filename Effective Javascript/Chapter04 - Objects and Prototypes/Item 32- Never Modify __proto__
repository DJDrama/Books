Item 32: Never Modify __proto__
	
	- "__proto__" property provides an additional power that "Object.getPrototypeOf" does not.

		-> ability to modify an object's prototype link.

	* Avoid modifying __proto__ is
		1) Portability
			-> not all platforms support the ability to change an object's prototype you simply can't write portable code that does it.

		2) Performance
			-> All modern JavaScript engines heavily optimize the act of getting and setting object properties
				+ Since these are some of the most common operations that JavaScript programs perform.

		3) Unpredictable behavior
			-> An object's prototype chain defines its behavior by determining its set of properties and property values.
			-> it swaps the object's entire inheritance hierarchy.
			-> inheritance hierarchy should remain stable.

	- Modifying "__proto__" actually changes the inheritance structure itself.
		-> the most destructive change possible.
