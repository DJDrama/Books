Item 67: Never Call Asynchronous Callbacks Synchronously

	* Never call an asynchronous callback synchronously, even if the data is immediately available.

	* Calling an asynchronous callback synchronously disrupts the expected sequence of operations and can lead to unexpected interleaving of code.
	
	* Calling an asynchronous callback synchronously can lead to stack overflows or mishandled exceptions.

	* Use an asynchronous API such as setTimeout to schedule an asynchronous callback to run in another turn.
