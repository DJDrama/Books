Item 65: Don't Blcok the Event Queue on Computation
	
	* Avoid expensive algorithms in the main event queue.

	- "Worker" API
		-> designed for parallelism (CPU-intensive tasks to run in a separate thread from the main thread (UI thread).)

	<-> "Async/Await"
		-> desgined for asynchronous programming, managing operations that involve waiting (e.g., network requests, file I/O, timers) without block the main thread.


	- Web Workers run in a separate thread with a dedicated JavaScript context.
		-> workers have no direct access to the DOM, window, or document, and communicate with the main thread via "postMessage".

		-> Offload CPU-bound tasks

	- Async/Await runs on the main thread with the same JavaScript context.
		-> uses the event loop to handle asynchronous tasks
		-> allowing the main thread to remain responsive during "await" operations.

		-> Efficient for I/O-bound tasks
