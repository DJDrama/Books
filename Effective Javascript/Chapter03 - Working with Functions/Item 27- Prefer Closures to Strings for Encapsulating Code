Item 27: Prefer Closures to Strings for Encapsulating Code
	
	- Strings are less flexible representation of code for one very important reason:
		-> they are not closures.

	* "eval"
		-> high-performance engines typically have a harder time optimizing code inside a string, since the source code may not be available to the compiler early enough to optimize in time.

	* Prefer APIs that accept functions to call rather than strings to eval.
