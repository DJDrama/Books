		-> you don't need to declare a function
		-> you can pass a block of code directly as a function parameter.

		* one of the main pillars of functional programming.


	- some of the hallmarks of functional programming
		-> First-class functions
			= Functions are treated as values.
			= You can store them in variables, pass them as parameters, or return them from other functions.

		-> Immutability

		-> No side effects
			= such functions are called "pured"
