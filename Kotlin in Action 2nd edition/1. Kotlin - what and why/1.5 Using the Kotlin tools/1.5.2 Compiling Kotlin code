1.5.2 Compiling Kotlin code
	- Kotlin is a compiled language
		-> before you can run Kotlin code, you need to compile it.

	- Kotlin code can be compiled to different targets:
		1. JVM bytecode (stored in .class files) to run on Java Virtual Machine
		2. JVM bytecode to be further transformed and run on Android
		3. Native targets to run natively on different operating systems
		4. Javascript (and WebAssembly) to run in browser


	(Compilation process for Kotlin/JVM)
		- Kotlin source code is normally stored in files with the extension .kt.

		- When compiling Kotlin code for the JVM target
			1. The compiler analyzes the source code and generates .class files, just like the JAVA compiler does.
			2. The generated .class files are then packaged and executed using the standard procedure for the type of application you're working on.
