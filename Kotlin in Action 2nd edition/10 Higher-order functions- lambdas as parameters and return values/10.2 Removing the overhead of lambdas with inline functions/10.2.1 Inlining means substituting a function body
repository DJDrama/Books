10.2.1 Inlining means substituting a function body to each call site

	* lambdas are normally compmiled to anonymous classes.
		-> every time you use a lambda expression, an extra class is created; and if the lambda captures some variables, then a new object is created on ever invocation.
		-> runtime overhead, causing an implementation that uses a lambda to be less efficient than a function that executes the same code directly.
