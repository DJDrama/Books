10.2.2 Restrictions on inline functions
	
	- Not every function that uses lambda can be inlined.

	- When inlined, the body of the lambda expression that's passed as an argument is substituted directly into the resulting code.

	* the parameter can be inlined if it's called directly or passed as an argument to another inline function.

	- If you have a function that expects two or more lambdas as arguments, you may choose to inline only some of them
		-> when one of the lambdas is expected to contain a lot of code or is used in a way that doesn't allow inlining.
		-> "noInline" modifier
			ex)
				========================================================================
				inline fun foo(inlined: ()->Unit, noinline notInlined: ()->Unit){
					...
				}
				========================================================================
