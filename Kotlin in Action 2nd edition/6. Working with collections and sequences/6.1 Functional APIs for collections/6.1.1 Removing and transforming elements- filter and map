6.1.1 Removing and transforming elements: filter and map

	- "filter" function goes through a collection and selects the elements for which the given lambda returns true.
		-> creates a new collection of elements that match a given predicate, but not transforming the elements in the process.

	- "map"
		-> creates new collection and also transform the elements in the process.

	- using member reference
		ex)
			========================================================================
			val people = listOf(...) // Person(...)

			people.map { it.name }

			people.map(Person::name)
			========================================================================
