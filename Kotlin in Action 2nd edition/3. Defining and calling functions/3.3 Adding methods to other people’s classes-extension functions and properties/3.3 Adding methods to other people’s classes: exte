3.3 Adding methods to other peopleâ€™s classes: extension functions and properties
	- "extension function"
		-> a function that can be called as a member of a class but is defined outside of it.
			ex)
				==========================================================================================
				fun String.lastChar(): Char = this.get(this.length-1)

				fun main(){
					println("Hello".lastChar()) // String is the receiver type, and "Hello" is the receiver object.
				}
				==========================================================================================
				-> first "String": Receiver
				- "this": Receiver Object

	- In the extension function, you can directly access the methods and properties of the class you're extending, as in methods defined in the class itself.

	* extension functions don't allow you to break encapsulation.
	* extension functions don't have access to private or protected members of the class.


	* On the callsite, extension functions are indistinguishable from members, and often it doesn't matter whether the particular method is a member or an extension.
