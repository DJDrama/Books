2.3.3 Capturing the subject of a "when" expression in a variable
	- "when" can be used as an expression(meaning that its result is used in an assignment or as a return value)
		-> the compiler enforces the construct to be exhaustive. (All possible paths must return a value)
			ex)
				================================
				// when expression: Exhaustive
				fun getSomething() = when(another){
					a-> "a"
					b-> "c"
					c-> "asfd"
				}
				================================
