2.1.5 Marking a variable as read-only or reassignable
	- Kotlin provides two keywords "val" and "var"
		1. val
			-> declares a read-only reference.
			-> can be assigned only once
			-> it can't be reassigned a different value (after it has been initialized)  (like "final" modifier in JAVA)

		2. var
			-> declares a reassignable reference
			-> like regular, non-final variable in JAVA
