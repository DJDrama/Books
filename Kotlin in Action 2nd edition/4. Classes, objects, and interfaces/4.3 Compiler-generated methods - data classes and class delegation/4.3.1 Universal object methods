4.3.1 Universal object methods

	- In Kotlin, the "==" operator
		-> compares their values by calling "equals" under the hood.
		-> thus, if "equals" is overriden in your class, you can safely compare its instances using ==.

		* "===" operator
			-> checks whehter two references point to the same object in memory.


	* "hashCode" method should be always overriden together with "equals".

	* "hashCode" contract
		- if two objects are equal, they must have the same hash code.
