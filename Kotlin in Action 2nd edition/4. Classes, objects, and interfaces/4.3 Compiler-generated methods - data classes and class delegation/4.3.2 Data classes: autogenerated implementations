4.3.2 Data classes: autogenerated implementations of universal methods
	
	- Data classes generate these methods automatically (toString, equals, hashCode)

	- immutability: the copy() method

	* it is strongly recommended to use only read-only properties(val) for data classes. -> making the data class immutable
		-> in multithreaded code, once an object has been created, it remains in its original state, and you don't need to worry about other threads modifying the object while your code is working with it.

	* In Java 14, records were introduced(very similar to Kotlin's data classes)
		* But "copy method" is absent in records.
