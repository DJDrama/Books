4.4.4 Object expressions: anonymous inner classes rephrased
	
	- object: also used for declaring anonymous objects.
		-> replace Java's use of anonymous inner classes.

	* anonymous objects aren't singletons!
		-> every time an object expression is executed, a new instance of the object is created.
