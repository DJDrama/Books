4.1.3 Visibility modifiers: public by default
	
	- Kotlin provides "public", "protected", and "private"
		-> "public": visible everywhere
		-> "protected" : visible in subclasses
		-> "private" visible inside a class, or, in the case of top-level declarations, visible inside a file.

	* not specifying a modifier is -> "public"

	- "internal" : restricting visibility inside a module.

	* Kotlin does not have package private  which is "default" in JAVA

	* extension functions don't get access to its "private" or "protected" members.
