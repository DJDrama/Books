4.1.4 Inner and nested classes: nested by default
	
	* Unlike JAVA, Kotlin nested classes don't have access to the outer class instance

	* A nested class in Kotlin with no explicit modifier is the same as a "static" nested class in Java.
		-> You need "inner" modifier for Kotlin to access outer class reference from inner class.


	- write this@Outer to access the Outer class from the Inner class
		ex)
			======================================================
			class Outer{
				inner class Inner {
					fun getOuterReference() = this@Outer
				}
			}
