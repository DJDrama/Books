7.1.11 Nullability and Java

	- Java
		@Nullable + type = (Kotlin) type?

		@NotNull + type = (Kotlin) type

	- When annotations aren't present, the Java type becomes "platform type" in Kotlin.
		(Java) Type = (Kotlin) Type? or Type

	- most of the Java libraries aren't annotated
		-> you may interpret all the types as "non-null"
