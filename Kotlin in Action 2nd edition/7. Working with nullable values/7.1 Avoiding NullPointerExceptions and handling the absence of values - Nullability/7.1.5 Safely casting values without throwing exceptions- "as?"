7.1.5 Safely casting values without throwing exceptions: "as?"

	- "as?" operator (safe cast)
		-> tries to cast a value to the specified type and returns null if the value doesn't have the proper type.

		-> you can easily check whether the parameter has a proper type, cast it, and return false if the type isn't right.
