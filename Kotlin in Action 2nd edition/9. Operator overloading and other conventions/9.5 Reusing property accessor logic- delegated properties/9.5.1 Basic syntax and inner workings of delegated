9.5.1 Basic syntax and inner workings of delegated properties
	- general syntax of a delegated property
		ex)
			var p: Type by Delegate()

			-> by convention, the "Delegate" class must have getValue and setValue operator functions, although the latter is required only for mutable properties.
			-> additionally, they can also provide an implementation for the "provideDelegate" function, in which you can perform validation logic or change the way the delegate is instantiated when it is first created.

		ex)
			======================================================================
			class Delegate {
				operator fun getValue(...) { ... }

				operator fun setValue(..., value: Type) { ... }

				operator fun provideDelegate(...): Delegate { ... }
			}
