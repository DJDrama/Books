9.5.2 Using delegated properties: lazy initialization and "by lazy()"

	- "Lazy initialization"
		-> common pattern that entails creating part of an object on demand, when it's accessed for the first time.

	- " by lazy { ... } "
		-> encapsulate both the backing property used to store the value and the logic ensuring that the value is initialized only once.
