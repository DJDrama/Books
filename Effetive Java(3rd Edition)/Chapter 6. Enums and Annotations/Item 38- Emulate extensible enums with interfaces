Item 38: Emulate extensible enums with interfaces

	- "operation codes" (aka "opcodes")
		-> enumerated type whose elements represent operations on some machine, such as the Operation type, which represents the functions on a simple calculator.


	* A minor disadvantage of the use of interfaces to emulate extensible enum
		-> the implementations cannot be inherited from one enum type to another.
		-> If the implementation code does not rely on any state, it can be placed in the interface, using default implementations.


	* While you cannot write an extensible enum type, you can emulate it by writing an interface to accompany a basic enum type that implements the interface.
		-> allows clients to write their own enums that implement the interface.
		-> Instances of these types can then be used wherever instances of the basic enum type can be used, assuming APIs are written in terms of the interface.
