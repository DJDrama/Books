Item 37: Use EnumMap instead of ordinal indexing

	- Don't use ordinals
		-> it is your responsibility to use the correct "int" value; "int"s do not provide they type safety of enums.
		-> If you use it with an array you may receive an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.

	- EnumMap constructor takes the "Class" object of the key type: this is a "bounded type token", which provides runtime generic type information.

	* Use EnumMap instead of ordinals.
