6.1.10 Merging collections: zip
	- "zip"
		-> you can use the zip function to create a list of pairs from values at same index from two collections.
		-> passing a lambda to the function also allows you to specify how the output should be transformed.

		ex)
			======================================================================
			fun main(){
				val names = listOf("Joe", "Mary", "Jamie")
				val ages = listOf(22, 31, 22, 44, 0)
				println(names.zip(ages)) // [(Joe, 22), (Mary, 31), (Jamie, 22)]

				println(names.zip(ages){name, age-> Person(name, age)})
				// [Person(name = Joe, age = 22), Person(name = Mary, age = 31),
					Person(name = Mary, age = 22)]
			}
			======================================================================
			* elements that don't have a counterpart in the other collection are ignored!

	* the size of the resulting collection is the same as the shorter of the two lists:
		-> zip only processes items at those indexes that exist in both input collections.
