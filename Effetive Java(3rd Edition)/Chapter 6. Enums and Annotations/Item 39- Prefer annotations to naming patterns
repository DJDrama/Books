Item 39: Prefer annotations to naming patterns

	- @Test --> "marker annotation" : has no parameters but simply "marks" the annotated element.

	* There is no reason to use "naming patterns" when you can use "annotations" instead.

	* all programmers should use the predefined annotation types that Java provides.
