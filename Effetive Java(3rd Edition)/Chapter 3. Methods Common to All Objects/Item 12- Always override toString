(Item 12: Always override toString)
	- Object toString method consists of the class name followed by an "at" sign(@) and the unsigned hexadecimal representation of the hash code
		ex) PhoneNumber@163b91

	- General contract for "toString": returned string should be "a concise but informative representation that is easy for a person to read."

	- It is recommended that all subclasses override toString method.

	- Providing a good toString implementation makes your class much more pleasant to use and makes systems using the class easier to debug.
		Ex) System.out.println("Failed to connect to " + phoneNumber);

	- When practical, the toString method should return all of the interesting information contained in the object.

	- Whether or not you decide to specify the format, you should clearly document your intentions.
		Ex)
			==================================================================
			/**
			* Returns the string ... comments
			* ...
			*/
			@Override
			public String toString(){
				return String.format("%03d-%03d-%04d", areaCode, prefix, lineNum);
			}
			==================================================================

	- provide programmatic access to the information contained in the value returned by toString.

	* override Object's toString implementation in every instantiable class you write, unless a superclass has already done so.
