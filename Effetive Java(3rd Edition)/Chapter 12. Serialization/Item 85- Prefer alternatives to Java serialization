Item 85: Prefer alternatives to Java serialization

	- a short stream that requires a long time to deserialize
		-> deserialization bombs

	* The best way to avoid serialization exploits is never to deserialize anything.

	* There is no reason to use Java serialization in any new system you write.

	- leading cross-platform structured data representations are JSON and Protocol Buffers(Protobuf)
		-> JSON (Douglas Crockford): browser-server communication
			- developed for Javascript
			- text-based and human-readable
			- data representation

		-> Protobuf (Google) : storing and interchanging structured data among its servers.
			- developed for C++
			- binary and substantially more efficient
			- schemas(types) to document and enforce appropriate usage.

	* Never deserialize untrusted data.

	* Seriously consider migrating to a cross-platform structured-data representation rather than serialization.

	* If you have to deserialize something, use object deserialization filtering (java.io.ObjectInputFilter)
