Item 86: Implement Serializable with great caution

	1) A major cost of implementing Serializable is that it decreases the flexibility to change a class's implementation once it has been released.

		- loses fields for information hiding.

		- Every serializable class has a unique identification number associated with it.
			-> if you fail to declare a serial version UID, compatibility will be broken, resulting in an InvalidClassException at runtime.

	2) Serializable increases the likelihood of bugs and security holes

	3) increase the testing burden associated with releasing a new version of a class.

	4) Implementing it is not a decision to be undertaken lightly.

	5) Classes designed for inheritance should rarely implement Serializable, and interfaces should rarely extend it.
