Item 89: For instance control, prefer enum types to readResolve
	
	- Any "readObject" method, whether explicit or default, returns a newly created instance, which will not be the same instance that was created at class initialization time.

	- "readResolve"
		-> allows you to substitute another instance for the one created by readOBject.

	* If you depend on "readResolve" for instance control, all instance fields with object reference types must be declared transient.
		-> If a singleton contains a nontransient object reference field, the contents of this field will be deserialized before the singleton's readResolve method is run.
			-> this allows a carefully crafted stream to "steal" a reference to the originaly deserialized singleton at the time the contents of the object reference field are deserialized.


	* Use enum types to enforce instance control invariants wherever possible.

	* if you cannot make enum types, but need a class to be both seriazliable and instance-controlled, you must provide a readResolve method and ensure that all of the class's instance fields are either primitive or transient.
