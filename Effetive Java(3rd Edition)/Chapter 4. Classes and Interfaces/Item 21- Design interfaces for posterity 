(Item 21: Design interfaces for posterity)
	* it is not always possible to write a default method that maintains all invariants of every conceivable implementation.

	* In the presence of default methods, existing implementations of an interface may compile without error or warning but fail at runtime.

	* adding default methods tshould be avoided unless the need is critical!
		-> however, they are useful for providing standard method implementations when an interface is created, to ease the task of implementing the interface.

	* it is still of the utmost importance to design interfaces with great care, even though default methods are now a part of the Java platform.

	* While it may be possible to correct some interface flaws after an interface is released, you cannot count on it.
