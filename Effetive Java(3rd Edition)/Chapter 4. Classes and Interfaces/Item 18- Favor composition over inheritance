(Item 18: Favor composition over inheritance)
	- Unlike method invocation, inheritance viloates encapsulation.
		-> superclass implementation may change from release to release, and if it does, the subclass may break.

	- Instead of extending an existing class, give your new class a private field that references an instance of the existing class.
		-> COMPOSITION design

	- Composition
		- forwarding : each instance method in the new class invokes the corresponding method on the contained instance of the existing class and returns the results. (forwarding methods)

	- Decorator pattern
