Item 74: Document all exceptions thrown by each method

	* Always declare checked exceptions individually, and document precisely the conditions under which each one is thrown using the Javadoc @throws tag.

	* Don't throw Exception, or worse, Throwable
		-> it obscures any other exception that may be thrown in the same context.

	* use the Javadoc @throws tag to document each exception that a method can throw, but do not use the throws keyword on unchecked exceptions.

	* If an exception is thrown by many methods in a class for the same reason, you can document the exception in the class's documentation comment rather than documenting it individually for each method.


	(Q)
		- Since Unchecked Exceptions such as NullPointerException, ArithmeticExceptions indicate  programming errors.
			-> declaring them in "throws" should be avoided.

		* Unchecked exceptions are runtime exceptions.
