Item 72: Favor the use of standard exceptions
	(Reusable Exceptions)
		- "IllegalArgumentException"
			-> when arguments are inappropriate

		- "IllegalStateException"
			-> when the invocation is illegal because of the state of the receiving object.

		- when passed "null" -> "NullPointerException" rather than "IllegalArgumentException"

		- when passed out-of-range value -> "IndexOutOfBoundException" rather than "IllegalArgumentException"

		- "ConcurrentModificationException"

		- "UnsupportedOperationException"
			-> if an object does not support an attempted operation.

	* DO NOT reuse Exception, RuntimeException, Throwable, or Error directly!!!
		-> You can't reliably test for these exceptions because they are superclasses of other exceptions that a method may throw.


	* Throw IllegalStateException if no argument values would have worked, otherwise throw IllegalArgumentException.
