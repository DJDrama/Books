Item 75: Include failure-capture information in detail messages
	
	- stack trace
		-> contains the exception's "string representation", the result of invoking its "toString" method.
		-> typically consists of the exception's class name followed by its detail message.

	* To capture a failure, the detail message of an exception should contain the values of all parameters and fields that contributed to the exception.
		ex) "IndexOutOfBoundsException"
			-> should contain the lower bound, the upper bound, and the index value that failed to lie between the bounds.
				("Fencepost error" : index could be one less than the lower bound or equal to the upper bound)
				or
				(wild value: far too low or high)

	* Do not include passwords, encryption keys, and the like in detail messages.
		-> for security

	* information content is far more important than readability.
		-> User-level error messages are often localized, whereas exception detail messages rarely are.

	- it is more important to provide such accessor methods on checked exceptions than unchecked
		-> failure-capture information could be useful in recovering from the failure.
