Item 77: Donâ€™t ignore exceptions

	* An empty catch block defeats the purpose of exceptions!

	(situations when it is appropriate to ignore an exception)
		1. when closing a "FileInputStream"
			-> you haven't changed the state of the file, so there's no need to perform any recovery action, and you've already read the informationk that you need from the file.
			-> so there's no reason to abort the operation in progress.

	* If you choose to ignore an exception, the "catch" block should contain a comment explaining why it is appropriate to do so, and the variable should be named "ignored"
		ex)
			==================================================
			try{
				...
			} catch (ExecutionException ignored){
				// not required
			}
			==================================================
