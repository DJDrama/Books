Item 63: Beware the performance of string concatenation

	* Using the string concatenation operator(+) repeatedly to concatenate n strings requires time quadratic in n.
		- Strings are immutable. (Cannot change)
		- When two strings are concatenated, the contents of both are copied.

	* Use StringBuilder for concatenation!
		-> it creates a single buffer for apending characters.

	* Don't use the string concatenation operator to combine more than a few strings unless performance is irrelevant.
		(Alternatively, use a character array, or process the strings one at a time instead of combining them)
