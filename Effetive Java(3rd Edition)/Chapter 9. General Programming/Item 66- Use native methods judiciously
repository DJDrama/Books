Item 66: Use native methods judiciously
	- JNI(Java Native Interface) allows programs to call native methods, which are methods written in native programming languages such as C or C++

	* It is rarely advisable to use native methods for improved performance.

	(Serious Disadvantages when using native methods)
		-> Native languages are not safe (applications using native methods are no longer immune to memory corruption errors)

		-> Harder to debug. (GC can't automoate, or even track, natvie memory usage)

		-> cost associated with going into and out of native code.

		-> require "glue code" that is difficult to read and tedious to write.

	* Use Native methods to access low-level resources or native libraries, use as little naive code as possible and test it thoroughly.

	* A single bug in the native code can corrupt your entire application.
