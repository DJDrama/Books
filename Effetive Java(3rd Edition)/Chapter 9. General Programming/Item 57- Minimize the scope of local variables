Item 57: Minimize the scope of local variables

	- You increase readability and maintainability of your code and reduce the likelihood of error.

	* The most powerful technique for minimizing the scope of a local variable is to declare it where it is first used.

	* Nearly every local variable declaration should conatin an initializer.

	* Prefer "for" loops to "while" loops. 
		-> "for" loops are completely independent, so no harm in reusing the element (or iterator) variable name.

		-> "for" loops are shorter, enhances readability.

	* keep methods small and focused.
