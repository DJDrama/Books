Item 59: Know and use the libraries

	(Advantages)
		1) By using a standard library, you take advantage of the knowledge of the experts who wrote it and the experience of those who used it before you.

			- As of Java 7, you should no lognger use "Random"
			* For most uses, the random number generator of choice is now "ThreadLocalRandom".
				-> produces higher quality random numbers!
				-> fast!

				-> For fork join pools and parallel streams, use "SplittableRandom"

		2) You don't have to waste your time writing ad hoc solutions to problems that are only marginally related to your work.

		3) standard libraries' performances tend to improve over time, with no effort on your part.

		4) libraries gain functionality over time.
			-> if a library is missing something, the developer community will make it known, and the missing functionality may get added in a subsequent release.

		5) you place your code in the mainstream.
			-> such code is more readable, maintainable, and reusable by the multitude of developers.

	* Numerous features are added to the libraries in every major release, and it pays to keep abreast of these additions.

	* every programmer should be familiar with the basics of java.lang, java.util, and java.io, and their subpackages.

	[Summary]
		- Don't reinvent the wheel.
