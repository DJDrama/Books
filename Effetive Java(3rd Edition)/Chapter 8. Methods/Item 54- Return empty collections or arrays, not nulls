Item 54: Return empty collections or arrays, not nulls

	- return same immutable empty collection repeatedly, as immutable objects may be
		-> Collections.emptyList
		-> Collections.emptySet
		-> Collections.emptyMap

	- for arrays, return zero-length array repeatedly because all zero-length arrays are immutable.
		ex)
			======================================================================
			private static final Cheese[] EMPTY_CHEESE_ARRAY = new Cheese[0];

			public Cheese[] getCheeses(){
				return cheesesInStock.toArray(EMPTY_CHEESE_ARRAY);
			}
			======================================================================

Bottom line: toArray(new T[0]) seems faster, safer, and contractually cleaner, and therefore should be the default choice now. Future VM optimizations may close this performance gap for toArray(new T[size]), rendering the current "believed to be optimal" usages on par with an actually optimal one. Further improvements in toArray APIs would follow the same logic as toArray(new T[0]) — the collection itself should create the appropriate storage.
