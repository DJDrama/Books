Item 53: Use varargs judiciously
	- "varargs" : variable arity
		-> accept zero or more arguments of a specified type.

		(Problems)
			* if the client invokes the method with no arguments, it fails at runtime rather than compile time!.
				ex) 
					========================================
					static int min(int ... args) {
						// ...
					}
					========================================
			* It is ugly!

	* Every invocation of a varargs method causes an array allocation and initialization!


(Question)
1. The static factories for EnumSet use this technique to reduce the cost of creating enum sets to a minimum. This was appropriate because it was critical that enum sets provide a performance-competitive replacement for bit fields (Item 36).
	-> EnumSet use what techinque?
