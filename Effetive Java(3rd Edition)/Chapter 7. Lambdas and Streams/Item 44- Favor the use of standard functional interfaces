Item 44: Favor the use of standard functional interfaces

	- "Template Method" pattern
		-> subclass overrides a "primitive" method to specialize the behavior of its superclass, is far less attractive.

		* Modern alternative
			-> provide a static factory or constructor that accepts a function object to achieve the same affect.


	* Always annotate your functional interfaces with the "@FunctionalInterface" annotation.
