Item 47: Prefer Collection to Stream as a return type

	- Collection interface is a subtype of Iterable and has a stream method.
		* Collection or an appropriate subtype is generally the best return type for a public, sequence-returning method.

	* Do not store a large sequence in memory just to return it as a collection.
