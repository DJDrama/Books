Item 43: Prefer method references to lambdas

	- "method references"
		ex)
			Integer::sum

	* many method references refer to static methods, but there are 4 kinds that do not.
		1. bound instance method reference
			-> the receving object is specified in the method reference.
			(the function object takes the same arguments as the referenced method)

		2. unbound instance method reference
			-> the receiving object is specified when the function object is applied, via an additional parameter before the method's declared parameters.
			(often used as mapping and filter functions in stream pipelines)

		3. "constructor references" for classes (serve as factory objects)

		4. "constructor references" for arrays (serve as factory objects)


	* method references are shorter and clearer, use them; where they aren't, stcik with lambdas.
