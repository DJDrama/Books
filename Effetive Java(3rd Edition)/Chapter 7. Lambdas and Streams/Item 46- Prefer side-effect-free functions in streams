Item 46: Prefer side-effect-free functions in streams

	- "Pure function"
		-> result depends only on its input: does not depend on any mutable state, nor does it update any state.

	* Any function objects that you pass into stream operations, both intermediate and terminal, should be free of side-effects.

	* "forEach" operation should be used only to report the result of a stream computation, not to perform the computation.


	["Collector"]
		- "reduction strategy"
			-> combining the elemnts of a stream into a single object.
				(object produced by a collector is typically a collection)

		(three such collectors)
			1. "toList()"

			2. "toSet()"

			3. "toCollection(collectionFactory)"


		- "groupingBy", "joining", and etc
