Item 81: Prefer concurrency utilities to wait and notify

	* Given the difficulty of using wait and notify correctly, you should use the higher-level conccurrency utilities instead.

	- java.util.concurrent
		1) Executor Framework
		2) Concurrent collections
			ex)
				- Map's "putIfAbsent(key, value)"
					-> inserts a mapping for a key if none was present and returns the previous value associated with the key, or null if there was none.
					-> thread-safe canonicalizing maps.

				- ConcurrentHashMap is very fast.

			* Use ConcurrentHashMap in preference to Collections.synchronizedMap

		3) Synchronizers
			- CountDownLatch
			- Semaphore
			- Phaser

	* For interval timing, always use System.nanoTime rather than System.currentTimeMillis.
		-> nanoTime is both more accurate and more precise and is unaffected by adjustments to the system's real time clock.

	- Try to use "notifyAll" rather than "notify"
		-> There is seldom, if ever, a reason to use wait and notify in new code.
