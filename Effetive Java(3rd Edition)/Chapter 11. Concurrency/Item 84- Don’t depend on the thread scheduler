Item 84: Donâ€™t depend on the thread scheduler

	* Any program that relies on the thread scheduler for correctness or performance is likely to be nonportable.

	* average number of runnable threads is not significantly greater thatn the number of processors.

	* Threads should not run if they aren't doing useful work.

	- Do not depend on the thread scheduler for the correctness of your program.

	- do not rely on Thread.yield or thread priorities.
		-> they should never be used to "fix" a program that barely works.
