Item 78: Synchronize access to shared mutable data
	
	* Synchronization is required for reliable communication between threads as well as for mutual exclusion.
		-> known as the "Memory Model"

	* Do not use "Thread.stop"

	* Synchronization is not guaranteed to work unless both read and write operations are syncrhonized.

	* increment operator(++) is not atomic.

	* Either share immutable data or don't share at all. (Confine mutable data to a single thread)

	* When multiple threads share mutable data, each thread that reads or writes the data must perform syncrhonization.
