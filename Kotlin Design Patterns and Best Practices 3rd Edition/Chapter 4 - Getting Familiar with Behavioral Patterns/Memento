[Memento]
	- holds potential in specific scenarios where reverting to a prior state is necessary.

	(example)
		1. [Encapsulate State] encapsulates internal state of objects, allowing them to be restored without exposing their structure or implementation details.

		2. [Supports Undo Operations] provides way to implement undo functionality in apps where users need to revert to previous states.

		3. [Maintains Encapsulation] maintains encapsulation -> class controls how its state is saved and restored, keeping its implementation details private.

	* useful in scenarios where maintaining the history of state changes and allowing users to revert those changes is crucial.
