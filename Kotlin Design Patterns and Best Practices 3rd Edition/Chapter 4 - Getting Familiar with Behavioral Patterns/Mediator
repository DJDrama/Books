[Mediator]
	- focused on facilitating communication between components (objects) without them having direct references to each other.
	- akin to a communcation overseer.

	- "strict" and "loose"
		-> "strict": instruct the mediator specifically and anticipate a direct response.
			+ can also be called sunchronous

		-> "loose": requires us to inform the mediator about events without waiting for an immediate reply.
			+ event-driven

	(Caveats)
		- risk of "God Object" (Anti-pattern)

		- example in Android (MVP pattern)
