[Builder]
	- useful when dealing with objects that require a multitude of parameters

	(limitations)
		1) code duplication
		2) separate setter function is required for each property.
		3) mutable variables raise concerns regarding thread safety and the potential for accidental modification of these properties outside of the intended Builder pattern.

	(Default arguments with use of named arguments)
		- In Kotlin, we can specify default values for constructor and function parameters.
			-> simplifies the process of creating complex objects.
