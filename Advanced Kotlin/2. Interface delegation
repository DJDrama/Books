[Interface delegation]
	
	(Delegation and inheritance)
		- inheritance only one class, but we can delegate to many objects.
		- Inheritance is a very strong relationship
		- most classes are not designed for inheritance as they are either closed or we just should not inherit from them.
		- Inheritance breaks encapsulation, causing safety threats.

	(Kotlin interface delegation support)
		- use the "by" keyword and specify the object that should be used as a delegate.
			-> this removes the "writing additional code" overhead.

	(Wrapper classes)

	(The decorator pattern)
		- uses delegation.
		- help us avoid implementing methods that only call similar decorated object methods.
			-> makes our implementation clearer and lets a reader focus on what is essential.
