(Chapter 13 - JavaScript and the Browser)

	[Networks and the Internet]
		- HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)
			-> protocol for retrieving named resources (chunks of information, such as web pages or pictures)

		- TCP(Transmission Control Protocol)
			1) one computer must be waiting, or listening, for other computers to start talking to it.

			2) each listener has a number (called a port)

			3) Most protocols specify which port should be used by default.
				ex) SMTP protocol, the machine through which we send it is expected to be listening on port 25.

			4) Another computer can than establish a connection by connecting to the target machine using the correct port number.
				-> if the target machine can be reached and is listening on that port, the connection is successfully created.

				* The listening computer is called the "server", and the connecting computer is called the "client".

			-> Such a connection acts as a two-way pipe through which bits can flow.

	[The Web]
		- World Wide Web

		- to become part of the Web, all you need to do is connect a machine to the Internet and have it listen on port 80 with the HTTP protocol so that other computers can ask it for documents.

		- Each document on the Web is named by a URL(Uniform Resource Locator)

			ex) http://eloquentjavascript.net/13_browser.html

				+ http : protocol
				+ eloquentjavascript.net : server (domain name)
				+ 13_browser.html : path

		* https : encrypted HTTP

		- Machines connected to the Internet get an IP address
			-> which is a number that can be used to send messages to that machine.

			-> But hart to remember and awkward to type, so you can instead register a "domain name" for a specific address or set of addresses.


	[HTML]
		- Hyper Text Markup Language
			-> document format used for web pages.

		- the document starts with <!doctype html>
			-> tells the browser to interpret the page as modern HTML

		- has a "head" and a "body".
			-> "head" contains information about the document

			-> "body" contains the document itself.

	[HTML and JavaScript]
		- <script> tag can be given an "src" attribute to fetch a script file(a text file containing a JavaScript program) from a URL.

			ex)
				======================================================
				<script src="code/hello.js"></script>
				======================================================
				+ when an HTML page references other URLs as part of itself web browsers will retrieve them immediately and include them in the page.
