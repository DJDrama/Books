[Prototype]
	
	- All about customization and creating objects that are similar but slightly different.

	- whole idea of a "prototype" is to be able to clone and object easily.
		(reasons)
			1. helps an instances where creating your object is very expensive
			2. helps if you need to create objects that are similar but vary slightly and you don't want to repeat similar parts over and over again.

	- Data classes have "copy()" method.
