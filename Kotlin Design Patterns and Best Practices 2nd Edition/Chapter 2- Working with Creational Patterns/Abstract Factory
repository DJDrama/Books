[Abstract Factory]
	- Factory of factories.
	- Factory: function or class that's able to create other classes.

	-> Abstract Factory: a class that wraps multiple factory methods.


		(Smart casts)
			- Kotlin compiler is very smart.
			- If we performed a type check on an if expression, it would mean that portProperty was indeed IntProperty.
				ex)
					=============================================================
					if(portProperty is IntProperty){
						val port: Int = portProperty.value 

						// No neeed to as below
						// val port: Int = (portProperty as IntProperty).value
					}

					=============================================================

	- ex) java.util.Collections class
		-> has methods such as emptyMap, emptyList, and emptySet, which each generate a different class.
		-> However, what is common to all of them is that they are all collections!
