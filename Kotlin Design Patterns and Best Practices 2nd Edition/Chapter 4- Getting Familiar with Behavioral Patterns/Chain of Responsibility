[Chain of Responsibility]
	
	- "filter chain" is a ubiquitous concept in web servers.
		-> when a request reaches you, it's expected that the following is true
			1. Its parameters have already been validated.

			2. The user has already been authenticated, if possible.

			3. User roles and permissions are known and the user is authorized to perform an action.

	- goal
		-> break a complex piece of logic into a collection of smaller steps, where each step, or link in the chain, decides whether to proceed to the next one or to return a result.

	- examples in real cases
		- "filters" or "middleware"
			-> handle cross-cutting concerns, such as authentication, authorization, logging, and even routing requests.
