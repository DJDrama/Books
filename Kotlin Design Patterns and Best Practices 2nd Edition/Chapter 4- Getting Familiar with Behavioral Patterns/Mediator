Mediator
	- a control freak.
		-> it doesn't like it when one object speaks to the other directly.

	- reduces coupling between objects.
		-> Instead of knowing some other objects, everybody should know only them, the mediator.

	(Two flavors)
		1. strict
			-> tell the mediator exactly what to do and expect and answer from it

		2. loose
			-> expect us to notify the mediator of what happened, but not to expect an immediate answer.
			-> instead if they need to notify us in return, they should call us.

	(Caveats)
		1. centralizes control
			-> may become a God Object

	(examples)
		- Usecase "CAN" be a mediator which receives an action from ui layer and fetch data from the data layer. BUT Usecase is not always a Mediator.

		- Usecase decouples presentation and domain layer.
