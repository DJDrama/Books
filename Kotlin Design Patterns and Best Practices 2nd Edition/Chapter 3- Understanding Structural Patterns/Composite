[Composite]

	- widely used in user interface (UI) frameworks.

		ex) Android: Group widget
				-> implementation of the Composite design pattern.
				-> it can group multiple other elements and implement the View interface in order to be able to act on their behalf.

	- As long as all the objects in the hierarchy implement the same interface, no matter how deep the nesting is, we can ask the top-level object to invoke an action on everything beneath it.
